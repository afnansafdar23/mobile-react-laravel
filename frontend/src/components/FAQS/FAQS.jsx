// Inside the component, an array named faqData is defined, containing FAQ items. Each item has a question, answer, and an open property, which is initially set to false.

// The toggleAnswer function takes an index as an argument and toggles the open property of the corresponding FAQ item to control the visibility of the answer.

// The component renders a container for the FAQ section with a title "Frequently Asked Questions."
